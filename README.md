# Farm-App-Application
The aim of this project is to create a graphical user interface to the application and also store/retrieve the data in external binary files.
# Aims and Objectives
The main application called FarmApp will be used to maintain information 
about animals and also the employees working in the farm. FarmApp will also 
have the main method and will provide the overall interaction with the 
application. Therefore, this class should include the main method where an 
instance of this class is constructed and the menu of commands is displayed to 
the user. Since we have not yet covered Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) in this 
course, you need to implement it as a command-line application.
